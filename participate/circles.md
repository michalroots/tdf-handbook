# Circles üîò

**Circles are decentralised groups of Members who take responsibility for a certain domain.** Circles work together with the team of Stewards on the ground to implement the Masterplan, as shown on the graph below:

![Stewards <> Circles](../.gitbook/assets/tdf-stewards-circles.jpg)

At the moment TDF includes the following circles:

- Architecture & Construction
- Land & Permaculture
- Legal & Governance
- Events
- Community & Communication

Members contributing their energy within a Circle get compensated with tokens and a free stay in glamping. The details are outlined for each circle.

For more information about each Circle and how to join, please consult our [Pink Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177JkHCy0AhplsaEEYpFHBsiI6d4uLk0TgURSKfBIewE/mobilebasic#h.slung3isnj8q)

# Visit Traditional Dream Factory
👉 **Always use [this form](https://airtable.com/shruhOwVE3vx4RiD3) to book your stay.**

TDF is a regenerative village being built. It is not a luxurious space yet but we put a lot of love into making the best version for this phase of the project to host and inspire you while you can also see and participate in the creative process of something pioneering coming to life.

You can visit TDF as a *guest*, *volunteer* or *member*. The details (including accommodation options, costs, food details, work exchange and how to get to TDF) are outlined in the [TDF Visitors Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/198vWYEQCC1lELQa8f76Jcw3l3UDiPcBKt04PGFKnUvg/edit).

⚠️ **To visit TDF you need to book your stay.** ⚠️

Traditional Dream Factory is waiting for you 💜.

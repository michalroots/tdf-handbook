**Being a Member of the Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) means that TDF is one of your homes 🌈,**

As a Member you can:
- book a stay at TDF without a need for approval
- stay at TDF at running costs, if you hold Carrots (our token)
- earn tokens in exchange for your contribution
- take part in our governance system and decision-making processes
- become a Steward
- (and more...)

With great power, however, comes great responsibility:

**We expect our Members to actively participate in developing TDF** by visiting at least once per year, participating in our community calls, and living up to the values of TDF. By applying to become a member of TDF, you commit to living up to our **[MemberSHEEP Agreement](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JURqf5qN71gQTMqFnCWYtNwbJCpHxHMu3nRXkfnpGZg/edit)**.

## How to Become a Member
After your first visit at TDF, you can be invited to start the journey of becoming a Member, following our vouching process.

You'll need to:
- spend some time at TDF (> 14 nights)
- fill in the application form below (which includes signing of the MemberSHEEP Agreement)
- receive three vouches from existing members

# MemberSHEEP üêë

**Being a Member of the Traditional Dream Factory (TDF) means that TDF is one of your homes üåà,**

As a Member you can:
- book a stay at TDF without a need for approval
- stay at TDF at running costs, if you hold Carrots (our token)
- earn tokens in exchange for your contribution
- take part in our governance system and decision-making processes
- become a Steward
- (and more...)

With great power, however, comes great responsibility:

**We expect our Members to actively participate in developing TDF** by visiting at least once per year, participating in our community calls, and living up to the values of TDF.

## Welcome to the Traditional Dream Factory
**A playground for living and creating together, and a regenerative living & creation collective based in Alentejo, Portugal.**

[Traditional Dream Factory](https://traditionaldreamfactory.com/) is the first village in the [Oasa network](https://oasa.co) - a network of co-owned regenerative villages on a mission to acquire ==100k hectars== of land to regenerate.

TDF is the first prototype - a village being built by Dreamers of different origins: engineers, artists, permaculturists, scientists, innovators, nomads.

Come build with us, play with us, grow with us.

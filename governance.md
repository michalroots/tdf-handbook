description: How we make decisions at TDF

# Governance Overview
Traditional Dream Factory is the first land-based DAO in Europe.

We're at the frontier of new ways of organising, and there are not many blueprints to follow yet. Here's how we are setting it up (in progress).

*Note: This is a birds-eye overview. For details consult respective [documents](/documents.md)*.

## Legal Structure
TDF is the first **Land Base** within **OASA Network**.

The **TDF Land** is held by a **Portuguese Company**.
The **Portuguese Company** is controlled by a **Swiss Association**.

**Swiss Association** is an entity in itself, that binds all Land Bases within OASA Network to the *Regenerative Land Use Agreement*. That's the foundational and common use ALL land-bases share. All other decisions, as long as they align with this agreement, are within the sovereignty of each Land Base. 

Each Land Base is governed by their respective **DAO**, which makes all decisions, in agreement with regenerative agreement.

Each Land Based DAO within OASA Network issues a **token** (in TDF we call it *Carrot*). 

Every *Member* who also holds *Carrots* can participate in the governance of TDF as explained in our [whitepaper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12DZovTtv3upFhDgRQuDj6pazV87MRv_I8PLnVxJufFQ/edit).

ℹ️  We're aiming to pre-launch Carrots in May 2022.

## Decision Making
TDF operates as a Do-ocracy:

> "As creatives we constantly generate ideas. Having mere proposals is adding an information load to the others. Taking action on those proposals, forming teams, creating an MVP, and pushing for the factoring of those ideas is what we stand for and want to see at TDF." -- [Pink Paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/177JkHCy0AhplsaEEYpFHBsiI6d4uLk0TgURSKfBIewE/mobilebasic)

To encourage collective alignment and proactive manifestation of our shared dream of REGENERATIVE living as a common planetary goal, we've adopted the following model of decision-making:

*Members* can participate in *Circles* - small working groups focused on a specific domain.

*Circles* make *decisions* within their domain and communicate with *Stewards* to compile and implement the *Masterplan*.

*Stewards* are *Members* on the ground who commit to steering TDF for a period of 3.5 months, and implementing the *Masterplan* created together with *Circles*.

ℹ  See the [Participate](/participate/README.md) section of this handbook for details on MemberSHEEP, Circles and StewardSHEEP.
